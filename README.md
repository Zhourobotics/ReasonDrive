# ReasonDrive: Reasoning-Enhanced Small VLMs for Autonomous Driving

Official implementation of "ReasonDrive: Efficient Visual Question Answering for Autonomous Vehicles with Reasoning-Enhanced Small Vision-Language Models"

![Example Frame](assets/example_frame.png)

## Overview

ReasonDrive investigates whether explicitly modeling reasoning during fine-tuning enhances smaller, deployable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on driving decision tasks. We introduce:

1. A reasoning-enhanced dataset derived from DriveLM using GPT-4o to generate structured reasoning chains for driving scenarios
2. Comprehensive evaluation of reasoning-based fine-tuning across multiple small VLM families
3. Evidence that explicit reasoning enhances internal representations for driving decisions

Our work shows that reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning creates efficient, interpretable models that address both computational and safety requirements for autonomous vehicles.

**Note:** While the model filenames on Hugging Face use "Cot" (Chain of Thought), we refer to these as "reason" models in our paper and documentation.

## Dataset

Our reasoning-enhanced dataset is available on Hugging Face:

- [ac4462/DriveLM-reasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ac4462/DriveLM-reasoning)

This dataset enhances the original DriveLM benchmark with structured reasoning chains for driving scenarios, generated using GPT-4o.

Please refer to [DriveLM dataset](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/DriveLM/tree/main/challenge#how-to-prepare-data) to prepare the dataset.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReasonDrive.git
cd ReasonDrive
```

## Docker Setup

We provide a Docker setup for reproducible environment:

```bash
# Pull the official Qwen Docker image
docker pull qwenllm/qwenvl:2.5-cu121

# Run Docker container with GPU support
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

## Using Pre-trained Models

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch
from PIL import Image

# Load model and processor (example for Llama 3.2)
model_name = "ac4462/Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-DriveLM-Cot"  # Use the "reason" model
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name, 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    device_map="auto"
)

# Load camera views
camera_views = []
for cam in ["front_left", "front", "front_right", "back_left", "back", "back_right"]:
    img_path = f"path/to/CAM_{cam.upper()}.jpg"
    img = Image.open(img_path).convert("RGB")
    camera_views.append(img)

# Prepare prompt
question = "In this scenario, what are safe actions to take for the ego vehicle?"
prompt = f"Question: {question}\n"

# Process inputs and generate response
inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=camera_views, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512)
response = processor.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(response)
```

## Unsloth Fine-Tuning

We use Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning of our models. Example command:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python scripts/vlm-finetuning.py \
    --model_id "unsloth/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit" \
    --output_dir "outputs_Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct" \
    --epoch 5 \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --use_wandb \
    --wandb_project "ReasonDrive" \
    --wandb_run_name "qwen2.5-3B-reason"
```


## Results

Our experiments demonstrate that reasoning-based fine-tuning consistently outperforms alternatives across multiple model families. The Llama3.2-11B-reason model achieves the highest overall performance while maintaining interpretability.
